# Documentation index

These maintained guides describe the current code, scripts, and test boundaries. Commands and versions are defined by `package.json`, the root `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `packages/relay/pnpm-lock.yaml`, and the actual workflows.

Fixed addresses, version hashes, and instruction signatures are defined by profiles, hooks, and tests in `src/games/`. Maintained documentation records purpose, boundaries, and verification entry points, without one-off terminal logs, machine-specific paths, or obsolete handoff notes.
